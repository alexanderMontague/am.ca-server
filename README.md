<i>My personal server that I use for www.alexmontague.ca</i>

- Currently this server is hosted on a raspberry pi, running 24/7 as my personal API and email server!
- I wanted a server that I could completely customize to my current needs, and have the scalability to fulfil my future needs!
- Currently can be accessed at `api.alexmontague.ca` try pinging `/resume` for a JSON representation of my resume!
- Using this server as an opportunity to learn GoLang and networking stuff while still being useful!
